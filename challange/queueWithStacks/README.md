# Stacks and Queues
stack is way to roganize data depend on the last input who will be the fisrt output FILO 
qeueu also way to organize data depend on the first input wil be first output FIFO 
## Challenge
how to build qeue class using metod of stack 

## Approach & Efficiency
all the method have O(1) for the time except the qeue method deqeue have O(n) cause we loop throw the node to evacuation and refill

## API
push : added item in the last 
pop : delete last item 
enqeue: add item in the last 
deqeue: remove the first item in the node 
peek : return value of front property 
is Empty : check if the node is empty
